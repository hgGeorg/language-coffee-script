# IcedCoffeeScript language support in Atom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hgGeorg/language-coffee-script-on-ice.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hgGeorg/language-coffee-script-on-ice)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to IcedCoffeeScript files in Atom.

Forked from [language-coffee-script](https://github.com/atom/language-coffee-script) package.

### Difference:
* IcedCoffeeScript support
* Mark function calls (pull request pending)
* ~~Since operators like `is`, `isnt`, `not` etc. are mostly used in control structure, those are also marked as such.~~
Syntax theme should color them accordingly to stay consistent.
* Assignment operators are marked as such.
